      <h2>Musician by night ðŸŒš</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I'm making music. I have been singing and playing guitar since I was 5
        years old. I play in a few bands around the Los Angeles area. My main project is the
        Americana band Wyman & the Wolves. I also make jazz music with the group McChicken.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can check out some of my solo stuff on SoundCloud or Instagram. I like jazz, blues, R&B,
        soul, rock, and country music.
      </p>
      <p>I am available to hire for gigs and recording.</p>
